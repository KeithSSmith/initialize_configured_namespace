* Initialize Configured Namespace

The process of initializing a configured namespace is a little convoluted. This repo contains the instructions for making a docker image that will do it for you, given a database server one can point at.

It requires that you have already setup a database somewhere, and can access it using the following four parameters:
+ USER :: Database user
+ PASSWORD :: Database user's password
+ HOST :: Hostname or IP address of host
+ PORT :: (Optional) Database port. Defaults to 3306 if not provided.

* Build
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker build --tag tobyhferguson/icn:latest .
#+END_SRC
* Run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker run -it --rm tobyhferguson/icn:latest USER PASSWORD HOST [PORT]
#+END_SRC
